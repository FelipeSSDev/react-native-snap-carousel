# This is a fork from [React Native Snap Carousel](https://github.com/meliorence/react-native-snap-carousel)

The project aims to make gradient fade-ins easier with a single new prop added

`gradientColors: string[]`

You pass an array of strings containing valid css color formats and the gradient will do the trick for you

<div align='center'>
Example:

</div>

## ⚠️ Note: This only works if you are using a flatlist. If you chose to use scroll view it won't work at all
